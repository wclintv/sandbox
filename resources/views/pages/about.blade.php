					SnapDsk grew organically from a operational need to seperate customer service representives from the more sensitive accounting side of the business. QuickBooks was the small business standard for accounting software, so we needed a solution that integrated seemlessly and in realtime.
				</p>
				<p>
					In our search, we discovered that most available solutions were bloated, overly complicated software, with often dubious synchronization with QuickBooks.  Popular options tended to focus on email marketing, retail management, or one-size-fits-all applications with too many features and complicated interfaces.  We needed something that was simple, easy to train, and focused on small service business.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since nothing good was available we decided to build our own, using over 25 years experience managing small service businesses.  Our first application, back up in 2010, was a simple customer 'rolodex' that sychronized with QuickBooks Desktop over a local office network.  Now, we've decided to leverage the advantages of cloud computing to make our customer profile manager available to everyone...online, portable, secure, and paperless.
				</p>
				<p>
					We use the most advanced web frameworks to secure your data.
				</p>
				<p>
					  The customer profile manager is just the first module queued for release.  We have big plans for SnapDsk, and our developers are working hard to add needed features without scarficing a simple, efficent user experience.
